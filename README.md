Our online community forums allow users to provide support to each other, share resources, and connect with others who have similar experiences.

## Cautious Mode

It also records the user's voice after 3 minutes for 1 minute and checks for a safe button response. If there is no response from the user within 1 minute, it will automatically trigger an SOS alert and inform the police and emergency contacts.
